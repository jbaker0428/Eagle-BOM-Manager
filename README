A BOM manager designed to interface with Eagle's BOM ULP scripts.

Scrapes product information off of distributor product pages.
All BOM and product information is stored in a local sqlite3 database.  

REQUIREMENTS:
---------------------------------------
The latest version of the BOM-AM, bom_w_attr, or BOM-EX ULP script, all of which are available at:
http://www.cadsoftusa.com/downloads/ulps
The basic bom.ulp script bundled with Eagle is not supported at this time due to lack of features, BOM-AM, bom_w_attr, and BOM-EX all work.

Note that while this tool was originally created to supplement the BOM management functionality of Eagle, it is fully compatible with any other EDA tool that can export a CSV file with the correct formatting. The supported input file formats may be expanded in the future to support other EDA tools should the need arise.

Required third-party Python (2.7) modules:
Beautiful Soup: http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
PyGTK: http://www.pygtk.org/
APSW: http://code.google.com/p/apsw/
---------------------------------------

IMPORTING DATA:
---------------------------------------
Export a CSV file from one of the Eagle BOM scripts with the following columns:
Name, Value, Device, Package, Description

A manufacturer part number attribute can be optionally added as a 6th column without adding a column header row.

Other part attributes from Eagle can be placed in additional columns. A column header row is required in this case.

When using a column header row, the manufacturer part number column does not need to be the 6th row. The header label for this row should contain one of the following (not case sensitive):
'partno'
'partnum'
'part number'
'part#'
'pn'

The file should have one component per line -- do not group components by value in the ULP.
